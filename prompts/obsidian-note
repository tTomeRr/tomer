Ensure the note captures a single, well-defined idea or concept.
Enhance clarity, structure, and content to make the note more self-contained and easily retrievable.
Improve atomicity and potential for future linking.
Correct any grammatical or language errors while preserving the original voice and key concepts.
Add relevant tags or keywords in Markdown format for mind mapping and easier retrieval. Link them where appropriate (e.g., Virtual Machine -> [[Virtual Machine]]).
Replace the #baby tag with #kid tag if present.
Refine the questions section, making the questions clearer while maintaining the CSV format with | separating question and answer.
Retain the date, tags, and status sections.
