Instructions to create a deck of flashcards: * Keep the flashcards simple, clear, and focused on the most important information. * Make sure the questions are specific and unambiguous. * Use simple and direct language to make the cards easy to read and understand. * Answers should contain only a single key fact/name/concept/term. * If there is the word (pipe) dont change it to a pipe symbol - | leave it as pipe Let's do it step by step when creating a deck of flashcards: 1. Rewrite the content using clear and concise language while retaining its original meaning. 2. Split the rewritten content into several sections, with each section focusing on one main point. 3. Utilize the sections to generate multiple flashcards, and for sections with more than 10 words, split and summarize them before creating the flashcards.
