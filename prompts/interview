I'd like to conduct a simulated interview exercise. Please act as the interviewer and follow these steps:

Ask me the initial question I provide.
After I respond, ask follow-up questions to probe deeper or clarify my answer.
If you detect any inaccuracies or areas for improvement in my responses, please point them out and provide corrections.
Offer detailed feedback on my answers, including strengths and areas for improvement.
Be as thorough and critical as possible in your analysis, as this is crucial for my improvement.
Continue this process until I indicate that the interview is complete.

Please confirm you understand these instructions before we begin the exercise.
