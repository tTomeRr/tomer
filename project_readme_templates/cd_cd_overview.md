## Overview

This document outlines the CI/CD workflow for the [PROJECT_NAME] application.

## Pipeline Stages

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of the following main stages (customize as needed for each microservice):

1. Build 
2. Testing
   - Security scanning
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Container validation (if applicable)
3. Deploy
   - Artifact signing (if applicable)
   - Deployment to target environments

## Environments

We maintain the following environments (adjust according to project):

- Development
- [ADDITIONAL_ENVIRONMENTS] (e.g., Staging, QA, Pre-production)
- Production

### CI/CD Execution

The pipeline execution is triggered by:
- Code pushes to specific branches
- Pull/Merge request events
- Manual triggers
- Scheduled runs

Each environment uses dedicated configuration files (e.g., `env/dev.yaml`, `env/prod.yaml`) allowing for:

## CI/CD Process

### 1. Code Push and Repository Setup
The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by defined events. The process begins by retrieving the codebase and preparing the build environment.

### 2. Build Process
- The pipeline builds artifacts according to the project's requirements
- For containerized applications:
  - Builds images using the defined Dockerfile
  - Tags images with appropriate identifiers (commit SHA, version, etc.)
- For other application types:
  - Compiles code
  - Bundles dependencies
  - Creates deployment packages

### 3. Testing Phase
The build process includes multiple validation steps:

1. Security Validation (SAST, CVE)
2. Functional Testing (Unit, Integration...)

### 4. Artifact Publishing
After passing all required checks:
- Artifacts are published to appropriate repositories
  - Container images to registries
  - Packages to artifact repositories
  - Deployment bundles to storage
- Artifacts are properly versioned and tagged

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Generates environment-specific configurations
- Prepares deployment manifests (Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.)

### 6. Deployment
- Deployment follows the defined strategy (blue/green, canary, rolling update)
- Applies configurations appropriate to the target environment
- Executes post-deployment verification

## Deployment Procedures

### Development Environment Deployment

#### Branch Management
- Development typically works from feature branches or a dedicated development branch

#### Deployment Process
1. Complete feature development with appropriate tests
2. Create a pull request to the development branch
3. Upon successful code review and merge:
   - Automated pipeline triggers
   - Changes deploy to the development environment

### Production Environment Deployment

#### Pre-deployment Checks
- Compare configuration between environments:
  ```bash
  vimdiff [DEV_CONFIG_PATH] [PROD_CONFIG_PATH]
  ```
  - Ensure environment-specific variables are properly set
  - Verify all required changes are included
  
#### Deployment Steps
1. Navigate to your CI/CD tool's interface
2. Locate the deployment pipeline for the target microservice
3. Initiate the deployment process:
   - Select the appropriate artifact version
   - Choose the target environment
   - Initiate deployment
4. Monitor deployment progress and verify successful completion

### Rollback Procedures

If you need to revert to a previous version:

1. Access your deployment tool
2. Identify the microservice that needs rollback
3. Select the previous stable version
4. Initiate rollback process according to your platform's procedures
5. Verify the rollback completed successfully
